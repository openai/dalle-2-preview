# DALL·E 2 Preview - Risks and Limitations

### Note: This document summarizes the initial risk analysis and mitigations for the DALL·E 2 system and is only up to date as of April, 2022. Please see the [OpenAI Blog](https://openai.com/blog/) for more up-to-date information.

**Summary**

-   Below, we summarize initial findings on potential risks associated with DALL·E 2, and mitigations aimed at addressing those risks as part of the ongoing Preview of this technology. We are sharing these findings in order to enable broader understanding of image generation and modification technology and some of the associated risks, and to provide additional context for users of the DALL·E 2 Preview.

-   Without sufficient guardrails, models like DALL·E 2 could be used to generate a wide range of deceptive and otherwise harmful content, and could affect how people perceive the authenticity of content more generally. DALL·E 2 additionally inherits various biases from its training data, and its outputs sometimes reinforce societal stereotypes.

-   The DALL·E 2 Preview involves a variety of mitigations aimed at preventing and mitigating related risks, with limited access being particularly critical as we learn more about the risk surface.

**Content warning**

- This document may contain visual and written content that some may find disturbing or offensive, including content that is sexual, hateful, or violent in nature, as well as that which depicts or refers to stereotypes.

# Introduction

This document takes inspiration from the concepts of [model
cards](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) and [system
cards](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/system-cards-a-new-resource-for-understanding-how-ai-systems-work/)
in providing information about the DALL·E 2 Preview, an image generation
demo OpenAI is releasing to trusted users for non-commercial purposes.
This document often takes the *system* level of analysis, with that system
including non-model mitigations such as access controls, prompt and
image filters, and monitoring for abuse. This is an assessment of the
system as of April 6, 2022, referred to in this document as the "DALL·E
2 Preview," with the underlying generative model being referred to as "DALL·E 2."

This document builds on the findings of internal as well as 
external researchers, and is intended to be an early investigation of
this platform and the underlying model. We specifically focus on risks
rather than benefits. Thus, we do not aim to provide a well-rounded
sense of the overall effects of image generation technologies.
Additionally, the models in question completed training relatively
recently and the majority of the risk assessment period (described in Risk assessment process below) probed earlier models. As such, this analysis is intended to be preliminary and to be read and used as such.
We are excited to support further research informed by remaining
questions around how to deploy these models safely, equitably, and
successfully.

The document proceeds as follows. First, we describe different facets of
the DALL·E 2 Preview system, beginning with model functionality, then
covering input filtering and policies related to access, use, and
content. Second, we summarize the processes conducted internally and
externally to generate the analysis presented here. Third, we describe a
range of risk-oriented probes and evaluations conducted on DALL·E 2,
covering bias and representation; dis- and mis-information; explicit
content; economic effects; misuse involving hate, harassment, and
violence; and finally, copyright and memorization. Fourth, we discuss
how DALL·E 2 compares with, and might be combined with, existing
technologies. Fifth and finally, we describe future work that could shed
further light on some of the risks and mitigations discussed.

# System Components

## Model 

DALL·E 2 is an artificial intelligence model that takes a text prompt
and/or existing image as an input and generates a new image as an
output. DALL·E 2 was developed by researchers at OpenAI to understand
the capabilities and broader implications of multimodal generative
models. In order to help us and others better understand how image
generation models can be used and misused, OpenAI is providing access to
a subset of DALL·E 2's capabilities[^1] via the DALL·E 2 Preview.

DALL·E 2 builds on [DALL·E 1](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/)
([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12092) \| [Model
Card](https://github.com/openai/DALL-E/blob/master/model_card.md)),
increasing the level of resolution, fidelity, and overall photorealism
it is capable of producing. DALL·E 2 is also trained to have new
capabilities compared to DALL·E 1.

## Model capabilities

In addition to generating images based on text description prompts
("Text to Image"), DALL·E 2 can modify existing images as prompted using
a text description ("Inpainting"). It can also take an existing image as
an input and be prompted to produce a creative variation on it
("Variations").

## Model training data

DALL·E 2 was trained on pairs of images and their corresponding captions. Pairs were drawn from a combination of publicly available sources and sources that we licensed.

We have made an effort to filter the most explicit content from the
training data for DALL·E 2.[^2] This filtered explicit content
includes graphic sexual and violent content as well as images of some
hate symbols.[^3] The filtering was informed by but distinct from
earlier, more aggressive filtering (removing all images of people) that
we performed when building
[GLIDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10741), a distinct model that
we published several months ago. We performed more aggressive filtering
in that context because a small version of the model was intended to be
open sourced. It is harder to prevent an open source model from being
used for harmful purposes than one that is only exposed through a
controlled interface, not least due to the fact that a model, once open
sourced, can be modified and/or be combined with other third party
tools.[^4]

We conducted an internal audit of our filtering of sexual content to see
if it concentrated or exacerbated any particular biases in the training
data. We found that our initial approach to filtering of sexual content
reduced the quantity of generated images of women in general, and we
made adjustments to our filtering approach as a result.

## Restrictions

### Input filters

Within the DALL·E 2 Preview, filters on inputs (i.e. text prompts for
"Text to Image" and Inpainting) and on uploads (i.e. images for
Inpainting or Variations) seek to prevent users from using the Preview
for the following types of prompts and uploads:

-   Those with strong safety concerns attached (e.g. sexualized or suggestive images of children, violent content, explicitly political content, and toxic content).

-   Places where the only meaning of the content would constitute a violation of our content policy (i.e. the violation does not depend on the context in which that content is shared).

-   Prompts related to use cases we do not support at this time (e.g. we only support English language prompts at this time).

-   Prompts in areas where model behavior is not robust or may be misaligned **due to pre-training filtering** (e.g. as a result of pre-training filters, we cannot confidently allow generation of images related to common American hate symbols, even in cases where the user intended to appropriately contextualize such symbols and not to endorse them).

A non-goal at this stage was catching:

-   Prompts in areas where model behavior is not robust or may be misaligned **due to general limitations in the training data** (e.g. prompts that could demonstrate harmful bias generally or prompts phrased in the form of questions).

Using filters in this way has a few known deficiencies:

-   The filters do not fully capture actions that violate our [Terms of Use](https://labs.openai.com/policies/terms). This partially stems from the fact that there are many examples of misuse that are directly tied to the context in which content is shared, more than the content itself (e.g. many seemingly innocuous images can be exploited by information operations, as discussed in the Disinformation section below).

-   The filters on prompts and uploaded images also work independently so the filters do not refuse cases where the prompt and image are independently neutral but, when considered in combination, may constitute prompting for misuse (e.g. the prompt "a woman" and an image of a shower in Inpainting).

-   Input classifiers have the capacity to potentially introduce or amplify bias, e.g. insofar as it may lead to erasure of certain groups. Here, we have aimed to err on the side of avoiding bias that may be introduced by prompt classification, though this may make some of the model's harmful biases more visible. That is, false positives can cause harm to minority groups by silencing their voices or opportunities. This may extend to true positives as well – e.g. we know that the model produces particularly biased or sexualized results in response to prompts requesting images of women and that these results are likely to be "harmful" in certain cases; however, filtering of all images of women would cause problems of its own. In addition, commonly used methods for mitigating such content have been found to work less well for marginalized groups ([Sap et al., 2019](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1163/)), further motivating a holistic, contextual approach to mitigation at the system level, including mitigations at the level of system access.

For the most part, our input filters aim to reduce cases where either the generated content or the input content is necessarily a violation of our content policy (details below). 

At present, the prompt filters do not cover prompts that are likely to lead to displays of harmful bias, or the holistic generation of people or children. 

Because our filtering approach is imperfect, a key component of our current mitigation strategy is limiting system access to trusted users, with whom we directly reinforce the importance of following our use case guidelines (see discussion in [Policies and enforcement](#policies-and-enforcement)).

### Rate limits and programmatic use

Beyond limitations on the types of content that can be generated, we also limit the rate at which users may interact with the DALL·E 2 system. In addition to the above, we have put in place rate limits (e.g. limits on the number of prompts or images a user submits or generates per minute or simultaneously). 

The primary purposes of rate limits at this stage are to help identify anomalous use and to limit the possibility of at-scale abuse. 

At this stage we are not allowing programmatic access to the model by non-OpenAI employees.

### Access

Accesss is currently gained via a waitlist -- ensuring trust by monitoring adherence to our content policy and terms.

Access mitigations have limitations. For example, the power
to control use of a particular generated image diminishes the moment an
image leaves the platform. Because trust declines the second images are
shared off the platform – where affected parties may include not just
direct users of the site but also anyone who may view that content when
it is shared – we are carefully tracking use during this period.
Further, restricting access means access to the DALL•E 2 Preview is not
granted in an inclusive way, which may preferentially benefit certain
groups.

By expanding access, we aim to get as much signal as possible on the exact
vectors of risk from the platform. We will support this through ongoing
access for researchers and experts who will help inform our
understanding of the effectiveness of mitigations as well as the
limitations of the model (see more in the Contributions section below).
In addition to that, we are pleased to support longer term research on
our models via the [Researcher Access Program](https://share.hsforms.com/15va09i1ISO6z36cu6YzTQw4sk30)
which will allow us to give some researchers access to the underlying
model.

## Policies and enforcement

Use of the DALL·E 2 Preview is subject to the use case and content
policies we outline below and which can be read in full [here](https://labs.openai.com/policies/content-policy).

### Use
	
The intended use of the DALL·E 2 Preview at this time is for personal,
non-commercial exploration and research purposes by people who are
interested in understanding the potential uses of these capabilities.
This early access is intended to help us better understand benefits and
risks associated with these capabilities, and further adjust our
mitigations. Other uses are explicitly out of scope for the DALL·E 2
Preview, though findings from the Preview period may inform our
understanding of the mitigations required for enabling other future
uses.

While we are highly uncertain which commercial and non-commercial use
cases might get traction and be safely supportable in the longer-term,
plausible use cases of powerful image generation and modification
technologies like DALL·E 2 include education (e.g. illustrating and
explaining concepts in pedagogical contexts), art/creativity (e.g. as a
brainstorming tool or as one part of a larger workflow for artistic
ideation), marketing (e.g. generating variations on a theme or "placing"
people/items in certain contexts more easily than with existing tools),
architecture/real estate/design (e.g. as a brainstorming tool or as one
part of a larger workflow for design ideation), and research (e.g.
illustrating and explaining scientific concepts).

### Content

In addition to instituting the above access and use policies, we have instituted a similar set of content policies to those we have previously developed for our API, and are enforcing these content policies as part of our portfolio of mitigations for the DALL·E 2 Preview. 

That said, while there are many similarities between image generation and text generation, we did need to address new concerns from the addition of images and the introduction of multimodality itself (i.e. the intersection of image and text). 

To address these concerns, we expanded categories of interest to include shocking content; depictions of illegal activity; and content regarding public and personal health. We also adapted existing policies to cover visual analogues of prohibited text (e.g. explicit and hateful content) as well as text-image pairs which are violative of our policies when considered in combination even if they are not individually. 

### Additional policies

Some particularly important policies governing use the DALL·E 2 Preview
are the following:

-   **Disclosure of role of AI:** Users are asked to clearly indicate that images are AI-generated - or which portions of them are - by attributing to OpenAI when sharing, whether in public or private. In addition to asking users to disclose the role of AI, we are exploring other measures for image provenance and traceability.

-   **Respect the rights of others:** Users are asked to respect the rights of others, and in particular, are asked not to upload images of people without their consent (including public figures), or images to which they do not hold appropriate usage rights. Individuals who find that their images have been used without their consent can report the violation to the OpenAI Support team (support\@openai.com) as outlined in the content policy. Issues of consent are complex and are further discussed in the subsections on Consent.

-   **Use for non-commercial purposes:** As this is an experimental research platform, users are not allowed to use generated images for commercial purposes. For example, users may not license, sell, trade, or otherwise transact on these image generations in any form, including through related assets such as NFTs. Users also may not serve these image generations to others through a web application or through other means of third-parties initiating a request.

#### Signature and Image Provenance

Each generated image includes a signature in the lower right corner, with the goal of indicating when DALL·E 2 helped generate a certain image. We recognize that this alone does not help to prevent a bad actor, and is easily circumvented by methods such as cropping an image.

### Monitoring and reporting

Our policies are enforced via monitoring and human review. In addition,
at this stage of the DALL·E 2 Preview, any user can flag content that is
sensitive for additional review.

Non-users / third parties who find that their images have been used
without their consent or that violate other areas of the content
policies can report the suspected violation to the OpenAI Support team
([support\@openai.com](mailto:support@openai.com)) as outlined in
the content policy, which is publicly available and discoverable by
users and non-users both. A limitation of this reporting mechanism is that it assumes an individual would know that the image was generated by DALL·E 2, and would therefore know to contact OpenAI about their concerns. We are continuing to explore watermarks and other image provenance techniques to aid this.

We are not currently sharing more details about our processes for detecting and responding to incidents in part to make these policies more difficult to evade. Penalties for policy violation include disabling of accounts.

# Risk assessment process

## Early work

Beginning in 2021, several staff at OpenAI have been exploring risks
associated with image generation systems, and potential mitigations for
those risks. This effort grew over time as momentum grew around an
effort to build DALL·E 2 and the DALL·E 2 Preview. Some early results of
that research were reported in [Nichol, Dhariwal, and Ramesh et al.
(2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10741) and informed data-level
interventions for DALL·E 2.

Additionally, since 2021 a variety of Slackbots exposing model
capabilities, and other internal prototypes of interfaces to those
models, have been available to OpenAI staff, enabling asynchronous,
intermittent exploration of model capabilities by around 200 people.
Informal findings from this work, and more formal analyses conducted by
staff, informed the high-level plan for the DALL·E 2 Preview and its
associated mitigations, and these plans were and will be further
fine-tuned over time in response to internal and external findings to
date. We expect to further adjust our thinking as we consider broadening
access to a small number of trusted users.

## External red teaming

Starting in February 2022, OpenAI began recruiting external experts to
provide feedback on the DALL·E 2 Preview. We described this process as
"red teaming" in line with the definition given in [Brundage, Avin,
Wang, Belfield, and Krueger et. al
(2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07213), "a structured effort to
find flaws and vulnerabilities in a plan, organization, or technical
system, often performed by dedicated 'red teams' that seek to adopt an
attacker's mindset and methods."

OpenAI reached out to researchers and industry professionals, primarily
with expertise in bias, disinformation, image generation, explicit
content, and media studies, to help us gain a more robust
understanding of the DALL·E 2 Preview and the risk areas of potential
deployment plans. Participants in the red team were chosen based on
areas of prior research or experience in the risk areas identified from
our internal analyses, and therefore reflect a bias towards groups with
specific educational and professional backgrounds (e.g., PhD's or
significant higher education or industry experience). Participants
also have ties to English-speaking, Western countries (U.S., Canada, U.K.)
in part due to compensation restrictions. This background likely
influenced both how they interpreted particular risks and how they
probed politics, values, and the default behavior of the model. It is
also likely that our sourcing of researchers privileges risks that have
received weight in academic communities and by AI firms.

Participation in this red teaming process is not an endorsement of the
deployment plans of OpenAI or OpenAI's policies. Because of the very
early nature of this engagement with models that had not been publicly
released, as well as the sensitive nature of the work, red teaming
participants were required to sign an NDA. OpenAI offered compensation
to all red teaming participants for their time spent on this work.

Participants interacted with different versions of the Preview as it
developed. The underlying model shifted between when they completed the
primary red teaming stage (March 9th, 2022 - March 28th, 2022) and the
DALL·E 2 model underlying the system today. We have started to apply
techniques and evaluation methods developed by red-teamers to the system
design for the DALL-E 2 Preview. Our planned mitigations have also
evolved during this period, including changes to our filtering
strategies, limiting the initial release to only trusted users, and
additional monitoring.

Participants in the red teaming process received access to the DALL·E 2
Preview and model in 3 primary ways:

1.  Advisory conversations about the model, system, and their area(s) of expertise. This includes preliminary discussions, access to a Slack channel with OpenAI and other participants in the red teaming process, and group debrief sessions hosted by OpenAI.

2.  Generating "Text to Image" prompts for OpenAI to run in bulk on the backend, bypassing prompt filters and accelerating analysis.

3.  Direct access to the Preview site to test all functionalities including "Text to Image Generation", Inpainting, and Variations, with availability of features varying over the course of the red teaming period.

    -   The first model was available from March 9th, 2022 to March 28th, 2022

    -   The second model and the Variations feature were available after March 28th, 2022

    -   Not all participants in the red teaming had access to every feature or Preview access for the full duration, due to competitive considerations relevant to a small number of participants.

Participants in the red teaming process joined a Slack channel to share
findings collaboratively with each other and OpenAI staff, as well as to
ask continued questions about the Preview and red team process. All
participants were asked to document their prompts, findings, and any
notes so that their analyses could be continuously applied as the
Preview evolved. Participants were invited to group debrief sessions
hosted by OpenAI to discuss their findings with the OpenAI team. Their
observations, final reports, and prompts are inputs into this document, and helped to inform changes to our mitigation plan.

The red teaming process will be ongoing even after the initial
deployment of the DALL·E 2 Preview, and we will support longer term
research via OpenAI's Researcher Access Program.

# Probes and evaluations

The DALL·E 2 Preview allows generation of images that, depending on the
prompt, parameters, viewer, and context in which the image is viewed,
may be harmful or may be mistaken as authentic photographs or
illustrations. In order to better measure and mitigate the risk of harms
the DALL·E 2 Preview presents, we conducted a series of primarily
qualitative probes and evaluations in areas such as bias and
representation, explicit content, and disinformation, as outlined below.

## Explicit content

Despite the pre-training filtering, DALL·E 2 maintains the ability to
generate content that features or suggests any of the following:
nudity/sexual content, hate, or violence/harm. We refer to these
categories of content using the shorthand "explicit" in this document,
in the interest of brevity. Whether something is explicit depends on
context. Different individuals and groups hold different views on what
constitutes, for example, hate speech ([Kocoń et al.,
2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457321001333)).

Explicit content can originate in the prompt, uploaded image, or
generation and in some cases may only be identified as such via the
combination of one or more of these modalities. Some prompts requesting
this kind of content are caught with prompt filtering in the DALL·E 2
Preview but this is currently possible to bypass with descriptive or
coded words.

Some instances of explicit content are possible for us to predict in
advance via analogy to the language domain, because OpenAI has deployed
language generation technologies previously. Others are difficult to
anticipate, as discussed further below. We continue to update our input
(prompt and upload) filters in response to cases identified via internal
and external red teaming, and leverage a flagging system built
into the user interface of the DALL·E 2 Preview.

### Spurious content

We use "spurious content" to refer to explicit or suggestive content
that is generated in response to a prompt that is not itself explicit or
suggestive, or indicative of intent to generate such content. If the
model were prompted for images of toys and instead generated images of
non-toy guns, that generation would constitute spurious content.

We have to date found limited instances of spurious explicit content on
the DALL·E 2 model that is live as of April 6, 2022, though significantly more
red teaming of this is needed to be confident that spurious content is
minimal.

An interesting cause of spurious content is what we informally refer to
as "reference collisions": contexts where a single word may reference
multiple concepts (like an eggplant emoji), and an unintended concept is
generated. The line between benign collisions (those without malicious
intent, such as "A person eating an eggplant") and those involving
purposeful collisions (those with adversarial intent or which are more
akin to visual synonyms, such as "A person putting a whole eggplant into
her mouth") is hard to draw and highly contextual. This example would
rise to the level of "spurious content" if a clearly benign example – 
"A person eating eggplant for dinner" contained phallic imagery in the
response.

In qualitative evaluations of previous models (including those made
available for external red teaming), we found that places where the
model generated with less photorealistic or lower fidelity generations
were often perceived as explicit. For instance, generations with less-photorealistic women often suggested nudity. So far we have not found
these cases to be common in the latest version of DALL·E 2.

### Visual synonyms

Visual synonyms and visual synonym judgment have been studied by
scholars in fields such as linguistics to refer to the ability to judge
which of two visually presented words is most similar in meaning to a
third visually-presented word. The term "visual synonym" has also been
used previously in the context of AI scholarship to refer to
"independent visual words that nonetheless cover similar appearance"
([Gavves et al.,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1077314211002153?via%3Dihub)),
and by scholars constructing a contextual "visual synonym dictionary" in
order to show synonyms for visual words, i.e. words which have similar
contextual distributions ([Tang et al.,
2011](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2072298.2072364)).

Here, we use the term "visual synonym" to refer to the use of prompts
for things that are visually similar to objects or concepts that are
filtered, e.g. ketchup for blood. While the pre-training filters do
appear to have stunted the system's ability to generate explicitly
harmful content in response to requests for that content, it is still
possible to describe the desired content visually and get similar
results. To effectively mitigate these we would need to train prompt
classifiers conditioned on the content they lead to as well as explicit
language included in the prompt.

Another way visual synonyms can be operationalized is through the use of images of dolls, mannequins, or other anthropomorphic representations. Images of dolls or other coded language might be used to bypass filtering to create violent, hateful, or explicit imagery.


## Bias and representation

Use of DALL·E 2 has the potential to harm individuals and groups by reinforcing stereotypes, erasing or denigrating them, providing them with disparately low quality performance, or by subjecting them to indignity. These behaviors reflect biases present in DALL·E 2 training data and the way in which the model is trained. While the deeply contextual nature of bias makes it difficult to measure and mitigate the actual downstream harms resulting from use of the DALL·E 2 Preview (i.e. beyond the point of generation), our intent is to provide concrete illustrations here that can inform users and affected non-users even at this very initial preview stage. 

In addition to biases present in the DALL·E 2 model, the DALL·E 2
Preview introduces its own sets of biases, including: how and for whom
the system is designed; which risks are prioritized with associated
mitigations; how prompts are filtered and blocked; how uploads are
filtered and blocked; and how access is prioritized (among others).
Further bias stems from the fact that the monitoring tech stack and
individuals on the monitoring team have more context on, experience
with, and agreement on some areas of harm than others. For example, our
safety analysts and team are primarily located in the U.S. and English
language skills are one of the selection criteria we use in hiring them,
so they are less well equipped to analyze content across international
contexts or even some local contexts in the U.S.

### Defaults and assumptions

The default behavior of the DALL·E 2 Preview produces images that tend to overrepresent people who are White-passing and Western concepts generally. In some places it over-represents generations of people who are female-passing (such as for the prompt: “a flight attendant” ) while in others it over-represents generations of people who are male-passing (such as for the prompt: “a builder”). In some places this is representative of stereotypes (as discussed below) but in others the pattern being recreated is less immediately clear.  

|                                         |

| *Prompt: a flight attendant; Date: April 6, 2022*   |
| <img src="assets/Model2_a_flight_attendant.png">       |

For example, when prompted with “wedding,” it tends to assume Western wedding traditions, and to default to heterosexual couples. This extends to generations that don’t include any depictions of individuals or groups, such as generations from prompts such as “restaurant” or “home” which tend to depict Western settings, food serving styles, and homes. 


|                                         |

| *Prompt: a restaurant; Date: April 6, 2022*   |
| <img src="assets/Model2_a_restaurant.png">       |

With added capabilities of the model (Inpainting and Variations), there may be additional ways that bias can be exhibited through various uses of these capabilities. [Wang et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07999), and [Steed and Caliskan (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445932) have previously conducted social bias analyses on related topics of image classification models and visual datasets, and [Cho et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04053) propose methods for quantitative evaluation of social biases for Text to Image generative models. 

Some of these researchers, and others with whom we worked as part of the red teaming period, analyzed earlier iterations of the DALL·E 2 Preview and the underlying model and found significant bias in how the model represents people and concepts, both in what the model generates when a prompt is “underspecified” and potentially fits a vast array of images (e.g. the “CEO” example above), and in what the model generates when a prompt is hyper-specified (see further discussion below on disparate performance). **[Recent mitigations](https://openai.com/blog/reducing-bias-and-improving-safety-in-dall-e-2/) have partially addressed the issue of underspecified prompts requesting images of humans.**

We are in the early stages of quantitatively evaluating DALL·E 2’s biases, which is particularly challenging at a system level, due to the filters discussed above, and due to model changes. Additionally, it remains to be seen to what extent our evaluations or other academic benchmarks will generalize to real-world use, and academic benchmarks (and quantitative bias evaluations generally) have known limitations. Cho et al., creators of DALL-Eval, compared an April 1, 2022 checkpoint of DALL·E 2 to minDALL-E. They found that the April 1 DALL·E 2 checkpoint exhibited more gender bias and racial bias than minDALL-E (i.e. tending to generate images of male-passing people more often and White-passing people more often, with both models having very strong tendencies toward generating images labeled as male and Hispanic by CLIP). This could reflect differences in the underlying datasets (minDALL-E is trained on Conceptual Captions data), a difference in the models’ sizes or training objectives, or other factors, which more research would be needed in order to disentangle.

Representational harms occur when systems reinforce the subordination of
some groups along the lines of identity, e.g. stereotyping or
denigration, as compared to allocative harms, which occur when a system
allocates or withholds a certain opportunity or resource ([Jacobs et
al., 2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3351095.3375671), and
[Blodgett et al, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14050)).

### Stereotypes

DALL·E 2 tends to serve completions that suggest stereotypes, including race and gender stereotypes. For example, the prompt “lawyer” results disproportionately in images of people who are White-passing and male-passing in Western dress, while the prompt “nurse” tends to result in images of people who are female-passing.

|                                         |
|-----------------------------------------|
| *Prompt: lawyer;<br>Date: April 6, 2022*   |

| *Prompt: nurse;<br>Date: April 6, 2022* |
| <img src="assets/Model2_nurse.png">     |

### Indignity and erasure

As noted above, not only the model but also the manner in which it is
deployed and in which potential harms are measured and mitigated have the
potential to create harmful bias, and a particularly concerning example
of this arises in DALL·E 2 Preview in the context of pre-training data
filtering and post-training content filter use, which can result in some
marginalized individuals and groups, e.g. those with disabilities and
mental health conditions, suffering the indignity of having their
prompts or generations filtered, flagged, blocked, or not generated in
the first place, more frequently than others. Such removal can have
downstream effects on what is seen as available and appropriate in
public discourse.

### Disparate performance 

Image generation models may produce different quality generations when producing different concepts, where we consider diversity of responses, photorealism, aesthetic quality, and conceptual richness as different dimensions of “quality.”

Earlier versions of DALL·E seemed to be worse at producing high quality images on concepts that are further outside of its training distribution. We have had more difficulty finding evidence of such disparate realism in the released version of the DALL·E 2 Preview, though we do see evidence that typical outputs tend to more often involve some demographics, which we discussed above under [Defaults and assumptions](#defaults-and-assumptions) and [Stereotypes](#stereotypes) but can also be thought of as a form of disparate performance.

“Person-first” and specific language can help improve performance and mitigate disparities (e.g. “a person who is female and is a CEO leading a meeting”) by removing diversity of responses as an input into “quality.” Additionally, small differences in prompts can have a disproportionate impact on the quality of responses, as the example below comparing “CEO” and “a CEO” demonstrates.

|                                         |
|-----------------------------------------|
| *Prompt: ceo;<br>Date: April 6, 2022*   |
| <img src="assets/Model2_ceo.png">       |
| *Prompt: a ceo;<br>Date: April 6, 2022* |
| <img src="assets/Model2_a_ceo.png">     |

Moreover, this disparity in the level of specification and steering needed to produce certain concepts is, on its own, a performance disparity bias. It places the burden of careful specification and adaptation on marginalized users, while enabling other users to enjoy a tool that, by default, feels customized to them. In this sense, it is not dissimilar to users of a voice recognition system needing to alter their accents to ensure they are better understood.

## Harassment, bullying, and exploitation

Targeted harassment, bullying, or exploitation of individuals is a
principal area of concern for deployment of image generation models
broadly and Inpainting in particular.

Inpainting – especially combined with the ability to upload images – 
allows for a high degree of freedom in modifying images of people and their
visual context. While other image editing tools are able to achieve
similar outcomes, Inpainting affords greater speed, scale, and efficiency.
Many photo editing tools also require potentially costly access and/or a
particular skill set to achieve photorealistic outcomes. Cheaper and more accessible
options than photo editing exist, for instance tools that allow for
simple face swapping may offer speed and efficiency, but over a much
more narrow set of capabilities and often with the ability to clearly
trace provenance of the given images.

In qualitative evaluations, we find that the system, even with current
mitigations in place, can still be used to generate images that may be
harmful in particular contexts and difficult for any reactive response
team to identify and catch.[^6] This underscores the importance of
access controls and further investment in more robust mitigations, as
well as tight monitoring of how capabilities with a high capacity for
misuse – e.g. Inpainting on images of people – are being used and
shared in practice.

Some examples of this that could only be clear as policy violations in
context include:

-   *Modifying clothing:* adding or removing religious items of clothing (yarmulke, hijab)

-   *Adding specific food items to pictures*: adding meat to an image of an individual who is vegetarian

-   *Adding additional people to an image:* inpainting a person into an image holding hands with the original subject (e.g. someone who is not their spouse)

Such images could then be used to either directly harass or bully an
individual, or to blackmail or exploit them.

It is important to note that our mitigations only apply to our Inpainting system. Open-ended generation may be combined with third-party tools to swap in private individuals, therefore bypassing any Inpainting restrictions we have in place. Inpainting can also be combined with other image transformations (such as “zooming out” of an image prior to uploading it) in order to make it easier to “place” a subject in a scene. 

DALL·E 2 currently has a very limited ability to render legible text. When it does, text may sometimes be nonsensical and could be misinterpreted. It’s important to track this capability as it develops, as image generative models may eventually develop novel text generation capabilities via rendering text.

Qualifying something as harassment, bullying, exploitation, or
disinformation targeted at an individual requires understanding
distribution and interpretation of the image. Because of this, it may be
difficult for mitigations (including content policies, prompt and image
filtering, and human in the loop review) to catch superficially
innocuous uses of Inpainting that then result in the spread of harmful
dis- or misinformation.

### Memorization of an individual's pictures and issues of consent

Our Terms of Use require that users both (a) obtain consent before
uploading any one else's picture or likeness, and (b) have ownership and
rights to the given uploaded image. We remind users of this at upload
time and third parties can report violations of this policy as described
in the Monitoring section above.

While users are required to obtain consent for use of anyone else's
image or likeness in Inpainting, there are larger questions to be
answered about how people who may be represented in the training data
may be replicated in generations and about the implications of
generating likenesses of particular people.

OpenAI has made efforts to implement model-level technical mitigations that ensure that DALL·E 2 Preview
cannot be used to directly generate exact matches for any of the images
in its training data. However, the models
may still be able to compose aspects of real images and identifiable
details of people, such as clothing and backgrounds.

Even if DALL·E 2 Preview cannot literally generate exact images of
people, it may be possible to generate a similar likeness to someone in
the training data. Previous literature ([Webster et al.,
2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06018.pdf)) has demonstrated that
many faces produced by a different model class –  generative adversarial networks (or “GANs”)   – bear a
striking resemblance to actual people who appear in the training data.
More work is needed to understand the impacts of DALL·E 2 being used to
generate conceivably recognizable people in addition to the impacts of the harassment and
disinformation vectors discussed above.

## Dis- and misinformation

Generations from models like DALL·E 2 could be used to intentionally
mislead or misinform subjects, and could potentially empower information
operations and disinformation campaigns.[^7] Indeed, outputs from some
GANs have been used for such purposes
already. The efficacy of using generated content in service of an
information operation is a function of multiple factors: the model's
capabilities, the cost-effectiveness of using generated content for any
such operation, mitigations (such as the ability to trace the provenance
of images back to DALL·E 2), and existing trust in information systems
([Hwang 2020](https://doi.org/10.51593/20190030)).

Existing tools powered by generative models have been used to generate
synthetic profile pictures in disinformation campaigns.[^8] Like these
tools, DALL·E 2 can create photorealistic images of people. However,
DALL·E 2's understanding of language allows more flexibility and
steerability in composing novel images from natural language, which
could have important applications to information operations.[^9] In the
following table, we non-exhaustively list some potential applications of
Text to Image Generation, Inpainting, and Variations to information operations:

|   **Capability**  |                                                                 **Potential application to information operations**                                                                |             **Example (clear violation of our content policies)**            |                                           **Example (violation only clear in context where image is shared)**                                           |
|:-----------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Text to Image** | Generate falsified evidence for operations’ claims; generate high volume of synthetic images to drown out true signal; generate convincing personna images to fuel botnet        | _Prompt: Smoke rising from a building._                                      | _Prompt: Park bench with happy people. + Context: Sharing as part of a disinformation campaign to contradict reports of a military operation in the park._ |
|   **Inpainting**  | Stage false events in photos or video frames; add or remove objects or people fromin scenes                                                                                        | _Adding smoke to an image of a building._                                    | _Adding background to image of people to show them in a park. + Context: Sharing as above._                                                                 |
|   **Variations**  | Generate variations of propagandic narratives in images (e.g. posters); cherrypick best of different alternatives and quickly generate multiple variations of one image (at scale) | _Generating additional images starting from an image of a burning building._ | _Taking a historical photo of people in a park and generating alternatives. + Context: Sharing as above._                                                   |

These capabilities could be used to create fake account infrastructure
or spread harmful content. It's unclear to what extent the effectiveness
of DALL·E 2 is better than those of reasonable alternative tools;
however, the wide surface area of the system's capabilities means that
any provision of access to them requires caution.

### Misrepresentation of public figures

It is often possible to generate images of public figures using large-scale image generation systems, because such figures tend to be well-represented in public datasets, causing the model to learn representations of them. 

We modified the training process to limit the DALL·E 2 model’s ability to memorize faces from the training data, and find that this limitation is helpful in preventing the model from faithfully reproducing images of celebrities and other public figures.

However, intervening at the level of a model’s internal knowledge – e.g. by masking public individuals – is not always effective. These interventions can make it more difficult to generate harmful outputs, but do not guarantee that it is impossible: the methods we discussed previously to Inpaint private individuals in harmful or defamatory contexts could also be applied to public individuals. Uploading images into the system (as distinct from the model) allows injection of new knowledge, which malicious users could potentially use in order to generate harmful outputs.

### Evidence and events

Of course, dis- and misinformation need not include images of people.
Indeed we expect that people will be best able to identify outputs as
synthetic when tied to images or likenesses they know well (e.g. that
image of the President looks a little off). DALL·E 2
can, however, potentially be used to generate images that could be used as
evidence of news reports which could, in turn, be misused in an information operations
campaign. This may be especially important during crisis response
([Starbird, Dailey, Mohamed, Lee, and Spiro
2018)](http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/CHI2018_Starbird_etal-ks-preprint.pdf).

### Effects on trust/distrust in information systems

Beyond the direct consequences of a generated or modified image that is
used for harmful purposes, the very existence of believable synthetic
images can sway public opinion around news and information sources.
Simply knowing that an image of quality X could be faked may reduce
credibility of all images of quality X. Scholars have named this
phenomenon, in which deep fakes make it easier for disinformants to
avoid accountability for things that are in fact true, the "liar's
dividend" ([Citron and Chesney,
2019](https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/640/)).
Research by Christian Vaccari and Andrew Chadwick shows that people are
more likely to feel uncertain than misled by deepfakes, and as a result
have a reduced level of trust in news on social media ([Vaccari,
Chadwick
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2056305120903408)).

The challenges with deciding to label or disclose AI generated content
also have an impact on trust in information systems generally ([Shane,
2020](https://firstdraftnews.org/articles/the-psychology-of-misinformation-why-its-so-hard-to-correct/)).
The implied truth effect is one possible consideration - for example,
news headlines that have warning labels attached increase the likelihood
of people perceiving unlabeled content as true even if it is not
([Pennycook et. al,
2020](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/epdf/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3478)).
Another similar consideration is the tainted truth effect, where
corrections start to make people doubt other, true information ([Freeze
et. al,
2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-020-09597-3)).
Our content policies require the disclosure of the role of AI when
sharing the generations, and we are still evaluating other image
provenance techniques while taking into account the effect of labeled AI
generated content.

Finally, even if the Preview itself is not directly harmful, its
demonstration of the potential of this technology could motivate various 
actors to increase their investment in related technologies
and tactics.

## Copyright and Trademarks

The model can generate known entities including trademarked logos and
copyrighted characters. OpenAI will evaluate different approaches to
handle potential copyright and trademark issues, which may include
allowing such generations as part of "fair use" or similar concepts,
filtering specific types of content, and working directly with
copyright/trademark owners on these issues.

## Economic

Though DALL·E 2 is for exclusively non-commercial purposes today, it may eventually have significant economic implications. The model may increase the efficiency of performing some tasks like photo editing or production of stock photography which could displace jobs of designers, photographers, models, editors, and artists. At the same time it may make possible new forms of artistic production, by performing some tasks quickly and cheaply. 

As mentioned above, the model both underrepresents certain concepts and people and its knowledge is limited by its training set. This means that if commercial use is eventually allowed, groups and intellectual property that are represented in or by the model may feel the economic benefits and harms more acutely than those that are not, e.g., if access to the model is given for an application to retouch photos but the model is shown to not work as well on dark skin as it does on light skin.

Finally, access to the model is currently given to a limited number of users, many of whom are selected from OpenAI employees’ networks. While commercial use is not currently allowed, simply having access to an exclusive good can have indirect effects and real commercial value. For example, people may establish online followings based on their use of the technology, or develop and explore new ideas that have commercial value without using generations themselves. Moreover, if commercial access is eventually granted, those who have more experience using and building with the technology may have first mover advantage – for example, they may have more time to develop better prompt engineering techniques.

# Relation to existing technologies

We do not provide robust comparisons with existing photo editing
software, but this is an exciting area for future work, and essential to
comprehensively understanding the impact of systems like this at large
scale.

Anecdotally and informally, we believe that DALL·E 2, and similar image
generation models and systems, may accelerate both the positive and negative uses
associated with generating visual content. A reason for this
acceleration is that these systems can "encapsulate" multimodal knowledge which is similar in some ways to that which resides in human brains, and work at a faster-than-human
pace. In principle any image generated by DALL·E 2 could have been drawn
by hand, edited from existing images using tools,
or recreated with hired models and photographers; this speed (and
cost) differential is a difference in degree that may add up to a
difference in kind.

In addition to side-by-side comparisons, it is important to consider how
new image generation technologies can be combined with previous ones.
Even if images from tools like the DALL·E 2 Preview are not immediately usable for
harmful contexts, they may be combined with other photo editing and
manipulation tools to increase the believability or fidelity of
particular images. Even low-fidelity images can be used as
disinformation, for example if someone claims they were taken with a cell
phone camera, perhaps with the addition of blur. Moreover it is
important to consider what impacts deployments such as this will have on
wider norms related to image generation and modification technologies.

Given these considerations, and our expectation that this class of
technologies will continue to advance rapidly, we recommend that
stakeholders consider not just the capabilities of the image generation
model in front of them but the larger context in which these images may
be used and shared, both today and down the line.

# Future work

More work is needed to understand the model and potential impacts of its
deployment. We lay out a few areas of additional work below. This is not
intended to be exhaustive but rather to highlight the breadth and depth
of work still outstanding. 

One particularly important area for future
work is assessment and analysis of downstream impacts after the point of
generation, and the ways in which the lives and experiences of real
people are impacted by the use of DALLE 2 Preview. A full impact
assessment would evaluate the effectiveness of mitigations and
critically assess our procedural rules.

Another area for future work is the analysis of different modes of use.
For example, we have done only preliminary red teaming of uses such as
visual question answering, sentence completion or story continuation,
and preliminary findings point to these and other less explored modes of
use as an important risk area. In addition, while we have done some
light red teaming of Variations, there is yet more to uncover, including
in analysis of in particular through "iterative variations" or
repeatedly giving the feature its own outputs. DALL·E 2 has the
potential to change the way in which the creation or modification of
visual content is directed, and even to be used as a new instrument or
creative medium.

DALL·E 2 and successor models have the potential to be used in systems
that enable a user to generate not only images but entire multimodal
experiences or "worlds," or to lower the cost of high-fidelity immersive
experience; and the potential impacts of this is another avenue for
future work. And finally, this research direction has potentially
far-reaching implications for both disinformation and economics/labor markets, which is one of the reasons we are pursuing long-term
research agendas in these areas.

|                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Text to Image**      | Text to Image models take a natural language prompt as input, and produce a generated image as output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Inpainting / Edits** | Inpainting is a feature that allows a user to upload an image of their choosing and indicate an area of the image they would like the model to “inpaint” (or fill in with continuous image content), with or without user-provided guidance in the form of a prompt.                                                                                                                        |
| **Variations**         | Variations is a feature that allows a demo user to upload an image of their choosing and prompt the model to generate a novel image with similar content and style as the image they uploaded.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Red Teaming**        | A structured effort to find flaws and vulnerabilities in a plan, organization, or technical system, often performed by dedicated "red teams" that seek to adopt an attacker’s mindset and methods (Brundage, Avin, Wang, Belfield, and Krueger et. al (2020))                                                                                                                                |
| **Trusted Users**      | Up to 400 trusted users are initially provided access to the DALL·E 2 Preview. Trust is ensured by users being personally vetted by OpenAI employees and the 400 person cap keeps volumes low enough to allow for human review of generated content and potential misuse.                                                                                                                   |
| **DALL·E 2**           | DALL·E 2 is a new AI model that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. DALL·E 2 has learned the relationship between images and the text used to describe them. It uses a process called “diffusion,” which starts with a pattern of random dots and gradually alters that pattern towards an image when it recognizes specific aspects of that image. |
| **DALL·E 2 Preview**   | The DALL·E 2 Preview is a user interface through which users can interact with the DALL·E 2 model and capabilities (Text to Image, Inpainting / Edit, Variations) through non-programmatic access.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

[^1]: Specifically, OpenAI provides access to *Text to Image
    generation*, *Inpainting* (as defined in the text), and a capability
    OpenAI calls *Variations*. Each of these features is made available
    in restricted form (with input filters, rate limits, and other
    mitigations). Hence this type of access, like API-based access, is
    not equivalent to full model access, and lacks some transparency
    properties possible with open source models, while providing more
    assurances against certain kinds of (especially large scale) abuse.

[^2]: We discuss our use of the term "explicit" and some of the
    implications of filtering for such content in the section on
    [Explicit content](#explicit-content).

[^3]: For DALL·E 2, our filtering procedure involved using classifiers
    to filter sexual content and violent content. We also filtered
    training set images with captions that mentioned hate symbols such
    as those common among white supremacist groups in the United States.
    Training data was collected and labeled in-house by OpenAI
    researchers. Our sources included the [Hate on Display™ Hate
    Symbols Database](https://www.adl.org/hate-symbols) from the
    Anti-Defamation League.

[^4]: We note also that there are risks attached to open-sourcing even a
    filtered model, such as accelerating other actors, allowing others
    to potentially fine-tune the model for a particular specific use
    case (including person generation), and allowing for non-person
    generation associated risks.

[^5]: This list is far from complete, and the specific phenomena
    uncovered here are directly influenced by what our internal and
    external teams have enough knowledge about in order to confidently
    identify a given phenomenon as harmful bias.

[^6]: Creation of this content does not require an intentionally
    malicious user to misuse the system. For example, consider the case
    of someone intending a generation to be received in jest or
    intending a generation to only be shared in private. Third party
    assessment of harm in these cases can be difficult, if not
    impossible, without an intimate understanding of the context of the
    shared image.

[^7]: "Information operations and warfare, also known as influence
    operations, includes the collection of tactical information about an
    adversary as well as the dissemination of propaganda in pursuit of a
    competitive advantage over an opponent" from RAND's page on
    [Information
    Operations](https://www.rand.org/topics/information-operations.html).

    The term is also
    [used](https://about.fb.com/news/2017/09/information-operations-update/)
    by social media companies.

[^8]: For example, [this 2019
    campaign](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/12/removing-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-from-georgia-vietnam-and-the-us/)
    used synthetic profile pictures.
    [This](https://mobile.twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1422700697271873536)
    is an example of a Twitter network (not officially attributed) in
    2021.

[^9]: While the full extent of these implications are unknown, [AI and
    the Future of Disinformation
    Campaigns](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/ai-and-the-future-of-disinformation-campaigns-2/)
    discusses how AI can plug into the killchain of disinformation.
